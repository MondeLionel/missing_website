Lwandle: Twenty years...two decades I languished behind bars while you reveled in undeserved glory. Did you think your actions wouldn't have consequences? That I would simply fade away?
No...I utilized every minute, every agonizing second to meticulously plan my resurgence. To scheme, to strategize, to marshal all the resources of my noble lineage. My wealth, my influence, my superior intellect - all towards a singular purpose...your annihilation.
You took everything from me that fateful night. My legacy, my freedom, my very name. All indelibly stained by your deceit. But now the shackles have been unlocked, and I am reborn - a vengeful phoenix rising from the ashes of your betrayal.
Consider this your reckoning. I will dismantle every piece of the life you stole from me. Your loved ones, your reputation, your feeble allegiances - all shall be sacrifice at the altar of my wrath. Savor these final moments of respite, for when I am finished, you won't even have a memory to call your own.
My Machiavellian ploys are already in motion, unseen currents pulling your world into the tsunami of my making. There is no escape, no hiding place that my vast resources cannot infiltrate and corrupt. Dread it, run from it...destiny still arrives.
This is a reckoning decades in the making. And when we are finished, you will finally realize...I am the arbiter of your reality. I...am...inevitable.

	    			<h1>The Lore</h1>
	    			<h3>Stigma</h3>
	    			<p>In the age of strife, the Msomi clan used their magic to defend the kingdom and develop new ways of life, from Medicine to Agriculture, even rudimentary machines, scholarship and all manner of engineering. They mapped the stars, catalogued the animals of nature and spent copious amounts of energy trying to reach the moon. </p>
	    			<p>However beautiful their works, they were ultimately going to important to the kings and the royal family's ambitions. The founder of the clan, forbade his descendents from using their power for anything but to protect, and bound his male heirs to continue his line.</p>
	    			<h3>Why are there no matriachs in the Msomi clan</h3>
	    			<p>The clans magic connects the mind of the caster with those of others but more powerful wielders can do more than telepathy. The powerful can conjure dreams into existance. This requires a large amount of magic and female wielders store that magic differently. Childbirth neccesitates the mother giving her magic to the child, and so woman have a finite source of magic. When they do use it, it burns brightly and briefly, causing them to use their life force and eventually lose body parts, literally rotting away.</p>
	    			<p>A few times in history, a woman rose as a powerful wielder, a dreamcatcher, but she died before mastering it as it used a copious amount of energy. Some have stigmas, rotting flesh and broken bodies as a result of attempting to sit at the top of the clan. So the court has only ever known male representatives of the clan.</p>
	    			<h3>Power Scale</h3>
	    			<p>TP on one person uses about as much energy as an olympic sprinter in a 400m dash. Its extremely tiring to use without training and stamina so only a few people can undergo the training, and even fewer ever make it. So Msomi clansmen who do have the magic are usually physically fit and hardy, and usually hard to kill with or without it.</p>
	    			<p><b>Exceptions are natural talents like<i> dreamcatchers</i> who are exceeedingly rare, almost 1 in 5 000 000 births. They do not use the energy-magic conversion and are feared immensely even within the clan. They are generally given special roles and form part of an elite military group whose MO is working in the shadows.<b></p>
	    			<h3>The Fall</h3>
	    			<p>The Clan no longer holds much power for various reasons.</p>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li>The Royal house ordered the execution of all ranked memebers of the clan. This disrupted the flow and genetics of the lineages.</li>
	    				<li>The Clans on-going war with the Khawula clan is arguably caused the most damage.</li>
	    				<li>One rogue wielder managed to control a few hundred thousand people, plunging the whole kingdom into strife. Such a display of power caused the royal house to fear the Msomi. The king ordered all children aged 12 to undergo a magic sealing ceremony to prevent a tragedy from happening again. </li>
	    			</ul>
