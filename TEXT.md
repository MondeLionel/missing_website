Lwandle: Twenty years...two decades I languished behind bars while you reveled in undeserved glory. Did you think your actions wouldn't have consequences? That I would simply fade away?
No...I utilized every minute, every agonizing second to meticulously plan my resurgence. To scheme, to strategize, to marshal all the resources of my noble lineage. My wealth, my influence, my superior intellect - all towards a singular purpose...your annihilation.
You took everything from me that fateful night. My legacy, my freedom, my very name. All indelibly stained by your deceit. But now the shackles have been unlocked, and I am reborn - a vengeful phoenix rising from the ashes of your betrayal.
Consider this your reckoning. I will dismantle every piece of the life you stole from me. Your loved ones, your reputation, your feeble allegiances - all shall be sacrifice at the altar of my wrath. Savor these final moments of respite, for when I am finished, you won't even have a memory to call your own.
My Machiavellian ploys are already in motion, unseen currents pulling your world into the tsunami of my making. There is no escape, no hiding place that my vast resources cannot infiltrate and corrupt. Dread it, run from it...destiny still arrives.
This is a reckoning decades in the making. And when we are finished, you will finally realize...I am the arbiter of your reality. I...am...inevitable.
