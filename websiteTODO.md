Here are the points formatted in markdown:

1. **Character Selection**  
Allow visitors to choose a character they want to explore the movie's world through. This could be the main protagonist, a supporting character, or even a villain. Provide brief character descriptions or visuals to help visitors make their choice.

2. **Interactive Environment**  
Create an interactive environment that represents a key location or setting from the movie. This could be a virtual recreation of a specific scene, a 3D model of a location, or a series of panoramic images. Ensure that the environment is visually appealing and immersive.

3. **Character Perspective**  
Develop the exploration experience from the chosen character's perspective. This could involve incorporating their thoughts, motivations, or even narration as visitors navigate through the environment. For example, if the chosen character is the protagonist, their internal monologue or thoughts could guide the exploration.

4. **Interactive Elements**  
Incorporate interactive elements that visitors can discover and interact with as they explore the environment. These could be objects, clues, or Easter eggs related to the character or the movie's plot. Interacting with these elements could reveal additional information, unlock new areas, or trigger specific events or animations.

5. **Character Development**  
As visitors progress through the exploration, consider revealing more about the chosen character's backstory, relationships, or personal journey. This could be done through audio logs, text entries, or even short video clips that play at specific points in the environment.

6. **Multiple Paths**  
Consider offering multiple paths or branching narratives based on the character chosen. Different characters may have access to different areas, uncover different clues, or experience different events within the same environment.

7. **Achievements or Collectibles**  
Implement a system of achievements or collectibles that visitors can earn or gather as they explore the environment. These could be tied to specific actions, discoveries, or challenges related to the chosen character.

8. **Social Integration**  
Allow visitors to share their exploration experiences on social media platforms. This could include sharing screenshots, achievements, or even their own character-driven stories or fan theories.

9. **Adaptability**  
Consider making the experience adaptable to different devices or platforms. For example, you could offer a desktop version with more immersive graphics and a mobile version with a simplified or optimized experience.

10. **Ongoing Updates**  
Plan for ongoing updates or expansions to the character-driven exploration. This could involve adding new characters, environments, or storylines based on feedback or to tie in with future movie sequels or related content.
